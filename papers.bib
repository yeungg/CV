abstract = {The path planning system is an important part of unmanned vehicles, and the development of path planning technology will surely promote the rapid development of unmanned vehicle technology. In order to prevent the node from continuously monitoring its state, a self-triggering control strategy is proposed. Before the trigger moment, the node does not need to monitor its state. Moreover, considering the unpredictable problem of the node state, a control strategy triggered by the observed event is proposed, that is, only the output state information is used to determine the trigger time. In addition, this paper analyzes and models the two major factors that affect the local planning results, the environment and the vehicle, and uses the path smoothing and optimization method based on B-spline curve and the path optimization method based on the steering controller. Finally, this paper designs experiments to analyze the vehicle local path planning method and time consistency of the unmanned driving system. From the experimental results, it can be seen that the unmanned driving system constructed in this paper has a certain effect.},

@article{Sun:2017,
 abstract = {Cyber physical systems (CPSs) incorporate computation, communication, and physical processes. The deep coupling and continuous interaction between such processes lead to a significant increase in complexity in the design and implementation of CPSs. Consequently, whereas developing CPSs from scratch is inefficient, developing them with the aid of CPS run-time sup-porting platforms can be efficient. In recent years, much research has been actively conducted on CPS run-time supporting plat-forms. However, few surveys have been conducted on these platforms. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate existing CPS run-time supporting platforms by first classifying them into three categories from the viewpoint of software architecture: com-ponent-based platforms, service-based platforms, and agent-based platforms. Then, for each type, we detail its design philosophy, key technical problems, and corresponding solutions with specific use cases. Subsequently, we compare existing platforms from two aspects: construction approaches for CPS tasks and support for non-functional properties. Finally, we outline several im-portant future research issues.},
